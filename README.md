# vue-first-project

A record of my first week of Vue.js learning. <br />
The project is a simple to-do list that uses Vue-cli, Router, and a fake JSON based backend. <br />



## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
